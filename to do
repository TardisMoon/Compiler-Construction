notes 9/26/23

need to read in int, can also do type float if want

creat an ast (Abstract Syntax Tree) https://sly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sly.html - more for after first check in but fine to try and do for first check in

creat a 3-addres code (due after first check in) 

get everyhting in a format we want, eg output look like tree or list
